Collection of interesting papers (read/to be read)

* [Grad-CAM](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Selvaraju_Grad-CAM_Visual_Explanations_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf) Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.  
(basically a method to nicely visualize model decision boundaries, very cool)

* [Cyclical Learning Rates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) Using Cyclical learning rates while training

* [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901)
